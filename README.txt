It’s designed to help traders evaluate where option participants might be trapped or in profit—and whether their behavior is creating gamma pressure.When we use the close from the day before, and work only on day after with it - we achieve a high volume reference band that rolls day to day easily.People using protection often are bad timers and market makers may feel forced to operate above the max, or below the min, of the bands.Note: This is a contextual range framework, not a trade signal. Entries require independent risk/reward logic.---TRADER OBSERVATIONS:Promotes objectivity—alerts are based on range breaks, not chart-watching.Rejections (wicks) during RTH are noise—confirmation comes at close.A close above/below range often triggers confirmation bias.15-minute data lag helps emotional detachment.Price staying within the buy-write zone = neutral zone; not bullish or bearish.---THESIS:Appendix I – The Squeeze DoctrineThe Dual-System Dilemma of Gamma SqueezesWhy is the universe not a unified field ?On products like SPY, QQQ, IWM, or VXX—our so-called mainline universe—there exists no single governing model of gamma, so we attempt to summarize:Electrical Systems → Delta exposure mechanics (think: GME-style squeezes, thin liquidity, price velocity from OTM call pressure)Mechanical Systems → Futures-based hedging rooted in macro variables (rates, divs, Fed posture, ETF inflows—aka "weather systems")When Gamma Is ElectricIn thin-volume names or meme conditions, the market maker is “electrically cornered”:Retail blitzes OTM callsDealer is short gamma, starts buying stock to hedgeCoiling and slingshot occur as directional flow builds and we see gapsShort-term put protection either fails entirely or overreacts—there’s no middle gearWhen Gamma Becomes Weather or MechanicalBut on the mainline? It’s different: Dealer can hedge bad calls with futures and baskets of stockLiquidity is deepDealers hedge exposure via futures or synthetic basketsGaps don’t manifest the same—SPY just grinds in stairsThere’s no visible coiling because time value distributes and hedging moves off-exchangeShort-term ATM buy-writes bleed gently—losses are shallow and briefHigh IV may bring better weatherWe see the switch may occur from high IV world and too many bad call or puts were taken by dealerBad calls and puts from dealer end wind up but,instead of the typical low volume to high volume stocks, SPY IWM QQQ VXX can be hedged into futures and out of direct calls and putsThe moment the dealers decide that bad calls and puts can be offset by letting time drain and hedges losses with futures is often theswitch from electrical to mechanical world on mainline movementsThat’s the problem: PRISMOR is watching protected movement. But on the mainline, the protection mechanism itself morphs—from delta management to macro gamma osmosis.So we can’t “see” gamma squeezes the same way in mainline index products, because:The market maker lives in both electrical and mechanical time. And they’ll switch modes without telling anyone.In short: PRISMOR isn't broken. The field isn't unified.---CONCLUSIONS:Doctrine Note – On Grounding the ProductThe Operational Insight:Ground the product → Move to spot equities when signal integrity breaks down in optionsDo not enter the mainline track → Avoid initiating new positions in option structures during directional grind or mechanical squeezesFutures are darkness and light → Powerful, fast, and value-shifting—but often invisible in their intention until momentum confirmsPRISMOR Interpretation LayerIn these conditions, PRISMOR recommends:Watching for synthetic hedging behavior (futures overriding option decay)Holding back from confirmation bias when IV stays suppressed during directional trendIdentifying unhedgeable flow not through volume, but through method switching or watching gaps go into stairsteps“In a universe that is not unified, you only work on grounded products—and you don't jump in front of the mainline track when the train’s on approach. Darkness and light is futures.”— SignalMaintainerLobb
