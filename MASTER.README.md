project name :   PRISMOR  ( Protective Implied Signal MonitOR ) 
UI           :   PIGOS    ( Protective Implied Generator Of Signals )
Purpose      :   Understanding Markets 			


PRISMOR OBJECTIVE:

These scripts help measure daily rolling volatility by using put and buy-write premiums at the previous day’s close. It’s designed to help traders evaluate where option participants might be trapped or in profit, with calculated bands.

When we use the close from the day before, and work only on the day after, with those values - we achieve a high volume reference band which rolls day to day easily.
People selling protection often are bad timers and market makers may feel forced to operate above the max, or below the min, of the bands.

This is a contextual range biasing tool framework.  Entries require independent risk/reward logic.
Understand these bands are essentially expected moves on the day of some sort.
Studies of expected move breaks have been done before and can be found easily.
This study is an advanced work on using implied volatility over volume or trend analysis.

Project PRISMOR aims to determine if movements outside the calculated bands help us understand a gamma squeeze better. 
Which trading products applies to PRISMOR and how it does.
PIGOS user interface ( UI ) will be used to determine band action alerts, to help trader confirm bias of market environment before analyzing trade set ups.
We do not ask PRISMOR trader for " Data on good trades ", we ask them, " Data on market insights that help your good trades ".

TRADER OBSERVATIONS:

- Promotes objectivity—alerts are based on range breaks, not chart-watching.				"Charts lose value"

- Rejections (wicks) during RTH are noise—confirmation comes at close.                                  "Traders are opening trades"

- A close above/below range often triggers confirmation bias.                                           "Traders are losing money"

- 15-minute data lag helps emotional detachment.							"Use PIGOS to find them"

- Price staying within the buy-write zone = neutral zone; not bullish or bearish.			"Relax, market got them, time to trade PRISMOR"

A THESIS ON PRISMOR:

The Doctrine :

The Dual-System Dilemma of Gamma Squeezes on the mainline vs on the side track - Electrical and Mechanical Markets 

- Products like SPY, QQQ, IWM, or VXX—our so-called mainline universe—there exists no single governing model of gamma, 
  so we attempt to summarize:
- Electrical Systems → Delta exposure mechanics (think: GME-style squeezes, thin liquidity, price velocity from OTM call pressure)
- Mechanical Systems → Futures-based hedging rooted in macro variables (rates, divs, Fed posture, ETF inflows—aka "weather systems")

When Gamma Is Electric with delta exposure
In thin-volume side tracked names or meme conditions, the market maker is “electrically cornered”:
- Retail blitzes OTM calls
- Dealer is short gamma, starts buying stock to hedge, no mechanical refuse for market maker in futures or baskets of stock
- Coiling and slingshot occur as directional flow builds and we see gaps
- Short-term put protection either fails entirely or overreacts—there’s no middle gear

When Gamma Becomes Weather or Mechanical 
But on the mainline? It’s different: Dealer can hedge bad calls with futures and baskets of stock
- Liquidity is deep; so IV is lowered to express that	
- Dealers hedge exposure via futures or synthetic baskets very fast	
- Gaps don’t manifest the same—SPY just grinds in stairs or violently between tight high and low	
- There’s no visible buy and sell coiling because time value distributes and hedging moves off-exchange
- Short-term ATM buy-writes bleed gently—losses are shallow and brief
- Risk pricing melts during - roll out - of high volume moves on brand new futures contracts

When Gamma Is Electric On the mainline vs on the side track,

For Mainline travelers High IV may grind into better weather 
We see the switch may occur from high IV world and too many bad call or puts were taken by dealer 
- Bad calls and puts from dealer end buy and sell wind up but,
- instead of the typical low volume to high volume as for stocks, SPY IWM QQQ VXX can be hedged into futures and out of direct calls and puts
- The moment the dealers decide that bad calls and puts can be offset by letting time drain and hedges losses with futures is often the
  switch from electrical to mechanical world on mainline movements

Mechanical weather from mainline products promote 'healthy Electrical' responses from higher relative volume products 


That’s the problem : PRISMOR is watching protected movement. As on the mainline, the protection mechanism itself morphs—from delta management to macro gamma osmosis.
So we can’t see 'stock buying' gamma squeezes the same way in mainline index products, because:
The market maker lives in both electrical and mechanical time. And they’ll switch modes without telling anyone.

In short: PRISMOR isn't broken. The electro-mechanical field isn't unified.


How Traders Use PRISMOR in Practice:

1. Pull prior close → Input ATM put & BW premiums
2. Watch PIGOS output → Alert zones signal contextual breaks
3. Confirm market mode → Use gamma squeeze notes to identify flow field
4. Set up trades after mode confirmed (Electrical or Mechanical)


“In a universe that is not unified, you only work on grounded products—and you don't jump in front of the mainline track when the train’s on approach. Darkness and light is futures.”

Ground your product:

The Operational Insight:
- Ground your product → Move with spot equities when signal breaks down
- Do not enter the mainline track → Avoid initiating new positions in option ranges during high IV
- Futures are used as darkness and light ; ON or OFF → Powerful and Fast but often invisible in their intention until p/l confirms

PRISMOR Interpretation Layer:

- Identify Squeeze Universe to pick flow type: 
  mainline universe ( SPY, IWM, QQQ or futures based products ) 
  delta based gamma stock universe ( GME, SMCI, PLTR or stock only )

  Electrical Option-Based Flow:
- Characterized by large price gaps at open and directional bursts
- Watching for hedges that break down (futures prices overriding option decay)

  Mechanical futures-Based Flow:
- Marked by stairstep trends or sharp moves between recent highs/lows
- Understanding When Gamma Is Electric with delta exposure, Identified Mainline mechanical forces may not exert pricing power 

Widened Bands from Global Hedging Impact:

“When PRISMOR bands Electrically widen without directional signal—neither breaking nor rejecting—this is late-stage confirmation that overnight futures volume has distorted RTH premiums. The market is pricing volatility from offshore mechanical stress, not domestic sentiment.”

- Band Behavior: Put and BW zones expand too much

- Volume Signature: Elevated AMC/BMO volume on mainline products (SPY, QQQ, IWM)

"Mainline spot AMC/BMO volume is the shadow cast by electrical futures conducted offshore. 
 It confirms that the electrical field isn’t just here and local—it’s global."

- Foreign desks attempt to exit US baskets of stock; with overnight futures and then are dumping stock covered options at next US open

so,

- Option exchanges close : futures begin to be used to exit stock covered option positions by places where regular trading hours ARE open 

- Option exchanges open : Now have this added risk from overnight futures being used by large traders to exit covered stock positions on THEM	

- Option prices need to :
   -open to reflect the ability for the market maker to cover this 'gain of losing position beta' they posses 
   -by guessing what the traders will do or hoping they show up BMO in the book 


Market Maker Response Logic

“I need to punish exit traders who front-ran expiry using futures—so I widen spreads, boost premiums, and wait for the real book to show up at BMO.”

- Market makers reprice premium not to attract flow, but to defend against being gamed.
- Spot IV suppression is strategic: keep ETF spreads tight, discourage asymmetric speculation.


Thus the inefficiency in option prices is set by,

- Overnight stock covered futures traders skewing US option market prices by exchange opening time and in profit exit method not by price or news alone.


The efficiency in futures is,

- Watching the environment and using bands to confirm stairstep or violent low protection to be long futures, which attempts to see foreign exit risk as less present.


The efficiency in spot or ETF's are,

- Suppressed IV or gains; as spread is always tighter.

Overseas Traders & Execution Friction :

Limited access to floor tech: Foreign desks often lack real-time block clearance capabilities tied to U.S. floor brokers.

- Machine-led burst exits: When large orders hit at once—often in clusters near open—it’s likely algorithmic liquidation timed to RTH visibility. These bursts can act as fingerprints of overseas desks exiting risk

Why Not Use Block Trades?
- Block trades require a trusted intermediary and post-trade reporting that can lag or not meet compliance for non US customers

- Futures → Options Spillover: The burst trades signal that traders passed open but skipped blocks, meaning what hits RTH is visible volume, not dark execution.

Signal Implications
BMO or AMC Burst trades ≈ “Foreign presence confirmed”
That pressure will skew RTH premiums, especially in BW zones.


Post-open bursts from lagged tech ≈ synthetic proxy exits:  They 'should' be using RTH blocks but fear or old technology and regualtions make them burst out BMO or AMC

- PRISMOR can detect this through early volume timestamps and premium aberration in AMC/BMO zones.
- Traders armed with this insight will know not to trust clean IV signals in early RTH if foreign tech lag induced basket dumps are detected.



So Electrcial based trading has technical issues beyond news and sentiment,


 Time Zone Asymmetry:

- Overseas traders react to news or macro flows hours before U.S. RTH opens.
- Execution occurs on futures first—but spot and options lag behind.
- Early futures moves may imply a risk shift, but they're just time-differentiated position exits or hedge rotations.


Tech Lag:

- Foreign desks with limited block trade access or slower clearing tech must use aggressive bursts or algos.
- That urgency causes futures to “jerk” without clean correlation to underlying sentiment.
- These bursts may resemble sell-offs or stair-step moves, but reflect execution mechanics, not price conviction.


Regulatory Mismatches:

- Differing reporting windows, margin rules, or order visibility across jurisdictions can create price distortion.
- Futures pullbacks may not be “risk-off”—they might be traders complying with pre-clearance windows or rolling hedges to meet capital thresholds.


PRISMOR's Advantage

Because PRISMOR observes band behavior across premiums, not just price, it acts as a filter for futures trading


"All futures pullbacks will be a foreign timestamp, lagged technology or compliance issue and not sentiment of forward price; as we expect a V shaped recovery."

 The Mismatch Theory of Dips
A framework for interpreting overseas or non US open price distortions in high-volume markets

The Premise
- Dips are not economic events.
- They're mechanical misfires—momentary desyncs in routing, liquidity access, and signal transmission.
- High volume triggers mismatches between intended flow and executed reality.
- News may trigger the initial destablization, but post drop mechanics take over as exchanges see unwanted flood of data to buy and sell 

Core Concepts
1. Volume-Induced Distortion
- Rapid inflows overwhelm trading infrastructure.
- Systems scramble to digest bad order flow, causing price to buckle under its own 'processing weight'.

2. Non-Conviction Price Movement
- Dips emerge NOT from seller conviction, but DATA confusion.
- Algorithms react to phantom DATA and mispriced DATA rather than narrative.

3. Mean Reversion as Structural Equilibrium
- As volume declines, routing friction clears.
- Matching logic normalizes, pricing re-aligns.
- Recovery is mechanical, NOT optimistic.

Tactical Implications
- Buy the Dip ≠ Bullish Sentiment
- Buy the Dip ≠ Bullish Sentiment
It's a bet on systemic healing, not corporate resurgence.
- Mismatches Love Gamma
Volatility traders may exploit mismatch echo rather than hedge true exposure.
- Fading the Overreaction
Discretionary traders use mispricing as a signal to fade the noise—not chase momentum.


"Overnight traders run out of ammo and the mismatches disappear, IV melts not from business risk but from data routes clearing up"

API Squeeze to request block trade or 'deal making':
More on 'The Theory of Dips'


Exchange API access open up and see burst addressing and deny entry with extreme elevated IV, messing with algo burst activity, 
not price moves and then close lower on expectation of dump from 'address request denial'


Access Denial via IV, Not Price
- Exchanges and their API handlers can selectively restrict burst participation—not by price walls but by jacking IV, which automatically destabilizes entry logic for algo nodes.
- It’s like saying: “Sure, the portal’s open—but your tech can’t handle the firestorm unless you’re latency-immune and volatility-native.”
- Participants interpret denied requests or failed syncs as warning signs. They don’t blame price; they suspect the environment is hostile.

And Then Comes the Dump
- Once denied burst access, participants shift forward expectation from rebalancing opportunities to risk shedding.
- This sets the stage for a late-session unwind: if the tech wasn’t permitted to address the imbalance, the assumption is that the imbalance will correct violently—and most will prefer to exit first, ask questions later.
The Psychological Cascade
It’s not just about rejection—it’s about signal transference:

| Signal Type | Interpreted As... | 
| IV spike at API sync | “This burst gate is too unstable for entry” | 
| Address request denied | “Books won’t be balanced properly today” | 
| Lower close after denial | “Dump is coming—offload before the reflex” | 

Why Premature Bursts Lead to Gap Downs
- Burst trades firing too early can signal desperation or uncoordinated flow. Instead of rebalancing, they trigger instability—and the broader market treats it as a warning.
- The result? Spot participants see risk rising, not falling, and shift to defensive positioning pre-open.
- And if the prior night saw dumping without resolution, the early bursts become confirmation of stress, not relief. Thus—gap down on open, grind lower all session.

Exchanges Crave Order, Not Chaos
The exchange wants “burst buys in blocks”, not a torrent of API-triggered aggression. Why?
- Blocks = arranged, symmetrical, negotiated.
- Bursts via API = frantic, fragmented, potentially dangerous.
- Imagine handling a flow of orders that almost no system is designed to handle, you may need a way to gate out unwanted network latency loads which translates to
  less algo trading and more blocks
It’s like plumbing: You want flow, not gushing. Exchanges prefer calling in their coordination layers—direct links, handshake agreements, shadow books—to absorb stress with minimal footprint, during market drops in elevated IV.

Let’s Break the Theory Down:
- Extreme IV = Market Congestion Protocol
- Exchange-based flows become unreliable—too reactive, too distorted.
- Bursts or price discovery become erratic → signal pollution.
- So the response is “turn off the taps”—pull market-making into safe mode.
- Deal-Making Becomes the IV Regulator

High IV = taps off , exchanges want volume low
low IV = taps on , exchanges want volume high

Which runs aginst the universe of volume watchers

________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________


IV as an Electrical-to-Mechanical Switch:


When IV melts, it’s not flow-driven at all, but:
- A protocol shift from reactive electrical signal behavior (noise, speculation, bursts)...
- Into mechanical field activation, where systems—algos, smart order routers, risk engines—start performing rather than forecasting.

In short:
IV melt = the exchange giving permission for technology-led liquidity to re-enter without chaos interference.
It’s not “IV down because fear down.”
It’s “IV down because the railways are clear, the routing channels are open and ready for you again.”

Control vs Indicator
- Normally, IV is priced like an asset: reflecting expectations, showing option premiums, etc.
- IV may actually be a governance mechanism request denial protcol for algo designers to understand as -> this will be too fast for your exit pricing bot 

- Its movement doesn’t just represent market tone—it authorizes market behavior.

- Like telling tech liquidity: “You may now behave in accordance with YOUR model logic.”
It’s the Flow Governance Phase Change. Not just a melt—it’s a structural recalibration of what kind of liquidity is allowed to lead.


It’s the performance art of liquidity architecture: exchanges are hinting at operational intent not through words or ticks, but through volatility kinetics and execution logic shifts.
