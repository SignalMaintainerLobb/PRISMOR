project name :   PRISMOR  ( Protective Implied Signal MonitOR ) 
UI           :   PIGOS    ( Protective Implied Generator Of Signals )
Purpose      :   Understanding Markets 			


PRISMOR OBJECTIVE:

These scripts help measure daily rolling volatility by using put and buy-write premiums at the previous day‚Äôs close. It‚Äôs designed to help traders evaluate where option participants might be trapped or in profit, with calculated bands.

When we use the close from the day before, and work only on the day after, with those values - we achieve a high volume reference band which rolls day to day easily.
People selling protection often are bad timers and market makers may feel forced to operate above the max, or below the min, of the bands.

This is a contextual range biasing tool framework.  Entries require independent risk/reward logic.
Understand these bands are essentially expected moves on the day of some sort.
Studies of expected move breaks have been done before and can be found easily.
This study is an advanced work on using implied volatility over volume or trend analysis.

Project PRISMOR aims to determine if movements outside the calculated bands help us understand a gamma squeeze better. 
Which trading products applies to PRISMOR and how it does.
PIGOS user interface ( UI ) will be used to determine band action alerts, to help trader confirm bias of market environment before analyzing trade set ups.
We do not ask PRISMOR trader for " Data on good trades ", we ask them, " Data on market insights that help your good trades ".

TRADER OBSERVATIONS:

- Promotes objectivity‚Äîalerts are based on range breaks, not chart-watching.				"Charts lose value"

- Rejections (wicks) during RTH are noise‚Äîconfirmation comes at close.                                  "Traders are opening trades"

- A close above/below range often triggers confirmation bias.                                           "Traders are losing money"

- 15-minute data lag helps emotional detachment.							"Use PIGOS to find them"

- Price staying within the buy-write zone = neutral zone; not bullish or bearish.			"Relax, market got them, time to trade PRISMOR"

A THESIS ON PRISMOR:

The Doctrine :

The Dual-System Dilemma of Gamma Squeezes on the mainline vs on the side track - Electrical and Mechanical Markets 

- Products like SPY, QQQ, IWM, or VXX‚Äîour so-called mainline universe‚Äîthere exists no single governing model of gamma, 
  so we attempt to summarize:
- Electrical Systems ‚Üí Delta exposure mechanics (think: GME-style squeezes, thin liquidity, price velocity from OTM call pressure)
- Mechanical Systems ‚Üí Futures-based hedging rooted in macro variables (rates, divs, Fed posture, ETF inflows‚Äîaka "weather systems")

When Gamma Is Electric with delta exposure
In thin-volume side tracked names or meme conditions, the market maker is ‚Äúelectrically cornered‚Äù:
- Retail blitzes OTM calls
- Dealer is short gamma, starts buying stock to hedge, no mechanical refuse for market maker in futures or baskets of stock
- Coiling and slingshot occur as directional flow builds and we see gaps
- Short-term put protection either fails entirely or overreacts‚Äîthere‚Äôs no middle gear

When Gamma Becomes Weather or Mechanical 
But on the mainline? It‚Äôs different: Dealer can hedge bad calls with futures and baskets of stock
- Liquidity is deep; so IV is lowered to express that	
- Dealers hedge exposure via futures or synthetic baskets very fast	
- Gaps don‚Äôt manifest the same‚ÄîSPY just grinds in stairs or violently between tight high and low	
- There‚Äôs no visible buy and sell coiling because time value distributes and hedging moves off-exchange
- Short-term ATM buy-writes bleed gently‚Äîlosses are shallow and brief
- Risk pricing melts during - roll out - of high volume moves on brand new futures contracts

When Gamma Is Electric On the mainline vs on the side track,

For Mainline travelers High IV may grind into better weather 
We see the switch may occur from high IV world and too many bad call or puts were taken by dealer 
- Bad calls and puts from dealer end buy and sell wind up but,
- instead of the typical low volume to high volume as for stocks, SPY IWM QQQ VXX can be hedged into futures and out of direct calls and puts
- The moment the dealers decide that bad calls and puts can be offset by letting time drain and hedges losses with futures is often the
  switch from electrical to mechanical world on mainline movements

Mechanical weather from mainline products promote 'healthy Electrical' responses from higher relative volume products 


That‚Äôs the problem : PRISMOR is watching protected movement. As on the mainline, the protection mechanism itself morphs‚Äîfrom delta management to macro gamma osmosis.
So we can‚Äôt see 'stock buying' gamma squeezes the same way in mainline index products, because:
The market maker lives in both electrical and mechanical time. And they‚Äôll switch modes without telling anyone.

In short: PRISMOR isn't broken. The electro-mechanical field isn't unified.

Doctrine Notes ‚Äì Ground your product

The Operational Insight:
- Ground your product ‚Üí Move with spot equities when signal breaks down
- Do not enter the mainline track ‚Üí Avoid initiating new positions in option ranges during directional grind 
- Futures are used as darkness and light ; ON or OFF ‚Üí Powerful and Fast but often invisible in their intention until p/l confirms

PRISMOR Interpretation Layer

- Understanding When Gamma Is Electric with delta exposure, Identified Mainline mechanical forces may not exert pricing power 

- Watching for hedges that break down (futures prices overriding option decay)

- Holding back from confirmation bias using IV alone until you identify the field- Electrical or Mechanical

- Using the extreme put bands breaking or not breaking as confirmational layers for biasing field

- Using the inside buy-write bands, to confirm low interest , low IV and low volume in markets

- Electrical gap up markets may switch to mechanical as price trades inside buy-write bands but IV stays elevated 

- Keep Positions open longer NOT through trend analysis or volume, but through confirming the method switched in the market 

- Mode switching may be induced, or may be indicated, by an outside move sticking to trap traders after big moves on calls or coiling with puts

- You cannot use news flow to trade against market price until environment is confirmed by losing traders watching price stick or IV go the wrong way on protection

  Electrical Option-Based Flow
- Characterized by large price gaps and directional bursts

üîß Mechanical Futures-Based Flow
- Marked by stairstep trends or sharp moves between recent highs/lows

One trader may use PRISMOR too confirm the mode switch and use that to identify trapped traders

Another trader may use PRISMOR to confirm market pricing IV trades at premium or discount based on movement in bands

Another trader may use PRISMOR to confirm volume with movement outside of bands, or even set up risk to reward based on band activity 

That is the beauty of the PRISMOR and PIGOS, it is an 'IMPLIED' range monitor; not a just a signal generator, so almost everyone can find it useful.


How Traders Use PRISMOR in Practice:

1. Pull prior close ‚Üí Input ATM put & BW premiums
2. Watch PIGOS output ‚Üí Alert zones signal contextual breaks
3. Confirm market mode ‚Üí Use gamma squeeze notes to identify flow field
4. Set up trades after mode confirmed (Electrical or Mechanical)


‚ÄúIn a universe that is not unified, you only work on grounded products‚Äîand you don't jump in front of the mainline track when the train‚Äôs on approach. Darkness and light is futures.‚Äù
